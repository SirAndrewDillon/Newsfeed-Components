            <h2>A Man Got A Letter Approving Unemployment Benefits For His Dog</h2>
            <p class="date">Dec 5th, 2018</p>
            <p>Times are ruff. For every dog with a successful career in therapy, police enforcement, or modeling, there are plenty who can't seem to catch a break, no matter how hard they chase it. And because begging makes you bad, what is an out-of-work
                good boy to do? File for unemployment, of course.
            </p>

            <p>One day, a Michigan man named Michael Haddock was checking his mail and, to his surprise, saw an official-looking letter from the State of Michigan addressed to his dog, Ryder. It was from the state's Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA), telling
                Ryder they were sorry he'd been laid off from his work at the restaurant, and that he'd been approved for a cool $360 per week in unemployment benefits. This confused Haddock. If Ryder was working at a restaurant, why had he never brought
                back any doggy bags? Also, dogs can't earn a paycheck.</p>

            <p>After the initial shock wore off, Haddock, a lawyer, figured something scammy was going on here. Looking at the letter again, he noticed that it was actually addressed to "Michael Ryder," a combination of Haddock's first name and his dog's
                only name. Haddock contacted the UIA, which investigated and found that the letter was supposed to go to Michael Ryder the person, not the German shepherd. However, the human Michael Ryder had never filed for unemployment, but instead
                had been a victim of one of the millions of identity thefts which happen in the U.S. each year. How the letter wound up in the paws of dog-Ryder though, nobody knows.</p>

            <p>As for Ryder, his benefits claim was eventually denied, and Haddock says he "[Does] not intend to assist Ryder in filing an appeal." Guess Ryder now needs to start looking for a new lawyer and new best friend.</p>

            <h2>Someone Stole Nearly $100,000 Worth Of Ramen Noodles In Georgia</h2>
            <p class="date">Dec 5th, 2018</p>
            <p>The victim left his truck parked at a gas station for a few days, and when he returned the truck had vanished — with all noodles in tow. In 2011, a group of thieves in Florida made off with $300,000 worth of tomatoes. They stole six tractor
                trailers filled with the produce, along with a truck of cucumbers and a truckload of frozen meat. Freezing temperatures in Mexico during the winter of 2011 impaired their crops significantly. This in turn skyrocketed the price for produce
                in the U.S., and the inflation specifically impacted the price of tomatoes, which is likely the reason as to why these thieves targeted tomatoes in their heist. It’s likely that their intention was to sell the tomatoes at a lower price
                than competitors and turn a profit off of the stolen goods.
            </p>

            <p>Similarly in 2013, Veniamin Balika was pulled over in his 18-wheeler over at a New Jersey Turnpike rest stop and was questioned by state police. Balika was driving a shipment totaling 42,000 pounds of Muenster cheese from the K&K Cheese/Old
                Country Cheese Factory, a cheese manufacturer in Canton, Wisconsin. The alleged destination that Balika was supposed to be headed towards was Texas, which is why it didn’t make sense for him to be in New Jersey. As it turns out, Balika
                never intended on making it to Texas and confessed to effectively stealing the cheese with the purpose of selling the product to anyone willing to pay him for it. Balika found himself in handcuffs shorty after his confession.
            </p>

            <p>“There’s a black market for everything,” said New Jersey state police detective Oliver Sissman at the time of Balika’s arrest. “We’ve seen everything stolen. We’ve found stolen beer, stolen food, stolen machine parts, but this is the first
                time we’ve found stolen cheese.”
            </p>

            <h2>Ohio Man Steals Police Cruiser, Leads Cops on Wild Chase</h2>
            <p class="date">Dec 5th, 2018</p>
            <p>Police in Ohio say a man stole a squad car while he was being transferred into the custody of sheriff's deputies and led officers and state troopers on a high-speed chase Friday Officers were called to a home in Lorain, west of Cleveland,
                for a report of a man going through a "mental crisis." They learned that the man, identified by Cleveland.com as 30-year-old Brandon Pettry, had an outstanding warrant with the Lorain County Sheriff's Office and took him into custody.
            </p>

            <p>Before the officers could complete the handover, the suspect broke free, jumped into a squad car and took off west on Ohio Route 113. The Lorain Morning Journal reported that he then turned north on U.S. Route 250 and Ohio Route 13, crossing
                into neighboring Erie County as he went. Video taken from a pursuing Ohio State Highway Patrol car showed the suspect driving at high speeds along rain-slicked roads. At one point, he drove through an unoccupied road construction area.</p>

            <p>The chase finally ended in Huron, where police deployed spike strips in an effort to stop him. The suspect drove over one of the strips, causing the cruiser to spin out and crash near a golf course. He was taken to a hospital for minor injuries
                before he was hauled off to jail. Erie County Sheriff Paul Sigsworth told Fox 8 that the cruiser had firearms in it, but Pettry was not able to access them.
            </p>

            <p>Cleveland.com reported that the outstanding warrant against Pettry was for breaking and entering. Pettry's mother told Fox 8 that her son had failed to appear for a court hearing because he was in the hospital.</p>
